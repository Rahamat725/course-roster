# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

1. Three features that I have added to this project

- Can't add duplicate item
- Can't credit more than 20 hour
- Remaining credit hour should not be less than 0


2. How I managed States in this project

In this project I have used three State, here I have discussed one of the State, which is counted total credit hour.
- First I import the hook from react
- Then I initialized the state

Here I provided a variable name for the state (creditHr) and a function to update the state (setCreditHr). Then I set the initial value (0) of the state which will be the value loaded by default every time the app starts.
Then I passed the state value through the Carts componets as a props, after receiving the props the state value placed where it shoud be. Every time to update state we have to use set function that we  decleared (setCreditHr) to use it.


=======

Add at least 3 Project features
